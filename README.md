📌 Project Overview

The Hall Booking Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of reserving halls for events, meetings, and functions. Developed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, this project was built as part of a hackathon during my first year of college.

🚀 Features

✔️ User-friendly Interface – Simple and intuitive design for easy navigation.
✔️ Booking System – Users can check hall availability and make reservations.
✔️ Responsive Design – Fully mobile-friendly layout using Bootstrap.
✔️ Real-time Updates – Displays booked and available slots dynamically.
✔️ Admin Panel (Basic) – Manage bookings and view reservation details.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
UI Framework: Bootstrap for a responsive and sleek interface

📌 How It Works

Users browse available halls and view their status (booked/available).
Select a hall and fill in the booking details (date, time, purpose).
Submit the request, and the system updates availability in real-time.
Admins can review and manage bookings through a simple dashboard.

🔗 Future Enhancements

Integrating JavaScript & PHP/MySQL for a fully functional backend.
Implementing user authentication for better security.
Adding email notifications for booking confirmations.

💡 Inspiration

The idea was inspired by the challenges of manual hall reservations in colleges and offices. This system aims to make bookings more efficient, reducing paperwork and scheduling conflicts.
